# PrimeNumbers
A program for a user to test if a number is prime. 

This was a fun challenge that required analytical, mathmatical, C++, and problem solving skills.  
It works by a number being entered, and then the program responds if it is a prime number or not. 
Such numbers are prime numbers and it was interesting to find out 7+ digit numbers as prime numbers
up to 1 000 000 000 000 (1000 billion).
